## Approach

This was a capstone project built during AlmaBetter training. Project goals included using frontend technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I was supposed to build a dashboard where the user can track coins through charts. I started this process by using the `create-vite-app` then adding `tailwind` ,`redux` and `axios`.

One of the main challenges i ran into was formatting and filtering the data without loosing the integrity of the data.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-redux, Axios, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-vite-app` boilerplate to minimize and speed up the initial setup and invest more time in diving into technologies.
